### What Is a Hardware Security Module?
<a href="https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2023/02/hardware-security-module-hsm.html">Hardware Security Module</a> is a physical device, mostly a USB stick that works as a crypto-processor and helps to store private/public keys in a secure environment. Its primary purpose is to restrict access to cryptographic keys and to assure that only authorized personnel are executing encryption or digital signing.

Furthermore, HSMs are considered more reliable and secure than software-based cryptographic key storage, as attackers canâ€™t access them through network or system breaches. if any hacker wants to breach the encryption keys, then the only way is to physically enter into premises and steal the module. Otherwise, itâ€™s not possible.

Moreover, it also prevents users from gaining knowledge about algorithms getting used to encrypt data. For instance, when an organization utilizes a hardware token (HSM) of an <a href="https://signmycode.com/ev-code-signing">EV Code Signing Certificate</a> to sign an application, it takes source code as input and provides encrypted code as output. No one knows the algorithm getting used between the input and the output procedure. And thatâ€™s how HSM also helps in adding layers of security.
